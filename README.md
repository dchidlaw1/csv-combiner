# CSV Combiner

csvcombiner.py is the main file

##  Considerations
* You should use coding best practices. Your code should be re-usable and extensible.
* Your code should be testable by a CI/CD process. 
* Unit tests should be included.

## Example
This example is provided as one of the ways your code should run. It should also be
able to handle more than two inputs, inputs with different columns, and very large (> 2GB) 
files gracefully.

```
$ py ./csvcombiner.py ./fixtures/accessories.csv ./fixtures/clothing.csv > combined.csv
```

Given two input files named `clothing.csv` and `accessories.csv`.
